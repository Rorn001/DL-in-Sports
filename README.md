# Application of Deep Learning Model in Sports: Detection, Classification, and Visualization of the Tracking of Ball and Players

## Overview
This project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to identify and track objects in sports-related images. It is implemented using TensorFlow, Keras, and the `ultralytics` package for YOLO-based detection.

## Features
- Uses `ultralytics` for YOLO object detection.
- Integrates `keras_cv` for bounding box handling.
- Loads and processes sports-related datasets.
- Trains and evaluates object detection models.
- Performs inference and visualizes results.

## Installation
To run the notebook, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install ultralytics keras-cv tensorflow matplotlib numpy
